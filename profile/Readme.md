# Inclusive Brains

Inclusive Brains develops adaptive, multimodal and non‚Äëinvasive brain computer interfaces to empower individuals‚Äîregardless of physical ability‚Äîto control digital environments using brainwaves, facial expressions, eye movements, or physiological signals. Our solutions aim to restore autonomy in work, education, and everyday digital life.

## üß† Prometheus BCI (Open Source)

**Prometheus BCI** is a multimodal brain‚Äìcomputer interface that translates diverse neurophysiological signals‚Äîincluding EEG, heart rate, eye movement, facial expressions, and muscle control‚Äîinto **mental commands**. These commands enable users to interact with connected devices without requiring touch or speech.

In 2025, Inclusive Brains and Allianz‚ÄØTrade committed to making the **Prometheus AI core algorithms open source**, inviting developers, researchers, and institutions to collaborate and innovate in assistive technology for accessibility and inclusion.

## üåç Notable Milestones & Impact

- **Paris 2024 Olympic Torch Relay**: Prometheus was used to control an exoskeleton arm by users with motor disabilities, enabling them to carry the Olympic torch. 
- **Mind-written communications**: First-ever instances of a tweet and a parliamentary amendment composed using Prometheus BCI - without physical or vocal interaction. 
- The open‚Äësource release of the core AI models and algorithms, aiming to democratize access to advanced neurotechnology for societal benefit.
